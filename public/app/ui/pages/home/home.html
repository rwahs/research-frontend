    <h1>Research Western Australian History</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the gateway for searching the catalogues of The Royal Western Australian Historical Societyâ€™s historical collections.  The items embraced by these records have been collected and managed by the Society since 1926 and include a wealth of information on many aspects of Western Australian history dating back to European settlement in 1826, with some going back even further.  The catalogues cover the Library, Museum, Photographs and Public Memorials collections.  They have been made accessible via the website so that users can search them from anywhere in the world for historical research and general interest purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can search the various catalogues separately or all together.

        The online Photographs collection catalogue is not complete.  If you cannot find an image you are looking for, please contact the Library on library@histwest.org.au.
